Port 53 (DNS):
- Used for resolving domain names to IP addresses (DNS).
- Mostly uses UDP, but also uses TCP for zone transfers or large responses.
- Common risks include DNS amplification attacks, spoofing, and tunneling for data exfiltration.
- Should be restricted to internal clients and monitored closely.
