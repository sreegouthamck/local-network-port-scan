Security Risks

- Attackers send forged requests to a DNS server that responds with a large reply to a target victim.

- Attackers trick DNS servers or clients into accepting malicious IP addresses for legit domains.

- If a DNS server on port 53 is exposed to the internet without restrictions, it can be abused by attackers.
